      <p>
        Vidcomply automates creation, localization, compliance review and packaging of trailers, promos and key art. Marketing and operations teams use it to plan and launch titles and campaigns into many countries and platforms with less manual work and lower risk, in a world where most of those assets are increasingly AI-generated or AI-assisted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The global video streaming market was estimated at about USD 129 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach roughly USD 417 billion by 2030, driven by rapid growth in SVOD, AVOD and live formats
        <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-streaming-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Grand View Research</a>.
        At the same time, AI video and AI-powered content creation markets are forecast to grow at high double-digit rates, reaching tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars by the early 2030s

        Today most of the work of turning titles and ideas into global releases is managed through a patchwork of tools, agencies and spreadsheets. Vidcomply turns this workflow into a single system: a campaign owner provides a brief and master assets, and Vidcomply plans what is needed for each platform and territory, orchestrates the right mix of creative tools and AI models, runs AI driven versioning and localization, enforces compliance rules and outputs platform ready packages with a clear audit trail.

        <div>
          <h2>Fragmented pipelines in an AI-native, short-form world</h2>
          <p>
            Streaming and high end video releases are global by default. A single season or campaign can require many trailers, cutdowns, shorts, social promos and hundreds of image variants. The shift toward short, premium-feeling video on CTV and social means that audiences and buyers expect more variants at higher frequency across more screens, not fewer
            <a href="https://www.storyboard18.com/brand-marketing/festive-marketing-81-consumers-prefer-short-videos-ctv-shoppable-formats-79789.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VDO.AI – 81% prefer short video</a>,
            <a href="https://www.wurl.com/reports/the-ctv-trends-report-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Wurl CTV Trends</a>.
            Each asset needs localized text, logos, ratings badges and legal elements, and must follow regional and platform rules. This complexity is exactly what slows down global enablement and expansion into new territories.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice this means scattered tools for editing, localization, QC and delivery, plus manual shot lists and spreadsheets passed between marketing, creative, legal and operations. Last minute compliance issues produce emergency blurs and cuts. Versions drift across platforms and territories. Launches are slowed, costs increase and risk remains high.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generative AI is already widely used, but in a fragmented way. A recent
            <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">McKinsey survey</a>
            found that 65% of organizations are now using generative AI regularly in their business, and marketing-specific studies show that around 70–90% of marketers report using AI in their day-to-day work

            New video generators such as Sora, Runway and Veo promise to make snackable and professional content exponentially cheaper

            Tools and agents proliferate, but as recent work on enterprise AI orchestration notes, the missing link is a platform-level layer that coordinates workflows, shares context and embeds governance across them rather than adding yet another isolated tool

            There is no shared brain that understands the full campaign, chooses the right tools and models for each job and guarantees that final assets are safe, on brand and ready to deliver.

            At the same time, new AI tools are flooding platforms with low-quality, mass-produced content. Serious brands and platforms need curated, governed pipelines, not just raw generation.

          <h2>Media release brain above tools, models and formats</h2>
          <p>
            Vidcomply is a model-agnostic media release brain. It translates a campaign brief and master assets into a structured plan, orchestrates creative tools and AI models to execute that plan, and enforces safety and readiness through a compliance engine. That execution can mean reusing and editing existing footage, or generating entirely new shots and short clips from text and reference images/video via connected generators such as Runway, Sora or in-house models.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system plans which trailers, shorts, promos and image variants are needed for each platform and territory, not just how to edit existing assets but what needs to exist for a title or campaign to be globally enabled. It uses AI to version and localize posters and key art, and to localize or cut trailers, animatics and social assets while respecting locked regions such as actor billing and logos. Every asset passes through film and streaming aware compliance rules. Where possible, Vidcomply applies automatic fixes such as blurs, trims or logo swaps. It then produces reports, timelines and delivery packages per platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upstream, Vidcomply’s planner can also assist with ideation and storyboard generation for promos and marketing beats, so that brief, story, asset list and compliance rules all live in one place. Downstream, it tracks status, continuity and approvals so that global release becomes a managed process rather than a collection of tools and ad hoc experiments.

              Checks both human-shot and AI-generated content against regional and platform rules, detects risky moments and supports automatic fixes. Can be used reactively on finished assets or earlier in the flow to flag risky prompts, storyboards and generation plans before they are produced. Outputs editor-friendly timelines and legal-ready summaries across long form, promos and shorts.
              <br /><br />
              <strong class="card-sub">Marketing asset studio</strong><br />
              Given a brief and references (stills, clips, brand guidelines, previous campaigns), the studio can either repurpose existing material or, via integrated generators (Runway, Sora and other models), create new shots, short clips and key art. It then turns those sources into localized and format-adapted variants per territory and platform, tightly integrated with the compliance layer. Supports both strict 1:1 versioning and safe creative exploration on top of AI generators, always keeping track of which prompt and tool produced which asset.
              <br /><br />
              <strong class="card-sub">Release planner</strong><br />
              Takes a brief plus reference assets, derives an asset plan by platform and territory, and breaks it into concrete operations: where to reuse, where to edit and where to generate from scratch. It assists with promo and storyboard ideation where appropriate, chooses which tools and models to call for each shot (edit vs generate), and tracks readiness, lineage and approvals for each platform to enable global launch.

          <h2>Current capabilities</h2>
          <p>
            Vidcomply already has a working compliance engine tuned to long form content, adaptable to shorter clips with simpler reporting. It can scan full titles, identify problematic shots and output structured timelines and reports for editors and legal teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the marketing side, Vidcomply supports poster and key art versioning and has an early trailer localization pipeline. The system can protect sensitive layout regions, localize text and graphics and link directly into compliance checks. An ideation and storyboard flow provides basic story structures for promos and marketing beats and will evolve into the planner that turns briefs into executable operations across assets, platforms and territories.
          </p>
          <p>
            These capabilities are already being applied to real Prime Video marketing workflows, which act as a design partnership and validation of the problem and approach.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Direction</h2>
          <p>
            The next steps focus on hardening the compliance core, productizing one or two sharp marketing workflows such as poster versioning and a specific trailer or promo task, and integrating the planner so that brief to asset per platform and territory becomes a visible, repeatable pipeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, more generative tools and models will plug into the same planner. Vidcomply will move from automating existing human made assets to orchestrating AI native promos, shorts and campaigns under the same safety and brand control rules, while remaining agnostic to which creative environment is used, from Runway and Sora to in-house tools and traditional NLE and VFX. This aligns with broader market trends where creative automation and AI-powered creative software are forecast to grow at high double-digit CAGRs through the 2030s

    <!-- Why now -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Why now</div>
      <p>
        Generative AI use in media and marketing is widespread, yet still fragmented. Surveys show that around 63% of large brand owners already use generative AI in their marketing strategies
        <a href="https://wfanet.org/knowledge/item/2024/09/17/eighty-percent-of-brands-have-concerns-about-agency-use-of-genai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">WFA</a>,
        71% of professional marketers use generative AI weekly or more
        <a href="https://www.ama.org/marketing-news/generative-ai-takes-off-with-marketers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">AMA</a>,
        and Adobe reports that 86% of global creators now use generative AI in their workflows, primarily for media editing, enhancement and asset generation

        The AI video generator market alone is projected to grow at around 20 percent a year this decade

      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the number of platforms and territories keeps growing and rules around AI generated and sensitive content are tightening. Streaming itself is on track to exceed USD 400 billion by 2030, while adjacent post-production, AI video and creative automation markets expand in parallel

        <a href="https://marketintelo.com/report/creative-automation-platform-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MarketIntelo</a>.
        Marketing and compliance teams are under pressure to move faster and reduce cost without increasing risk, especially when enabling global releases into many markets at once and when much of the content is AI generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tools like Runway, Sora and Veo are rapidly becoming powerful creative environments for generating snackable and professional video. They will make content far cheaper and more abundant

        At the same time, studios, agencies and unions are raising concerns about copyright, creator rights and provenance

        As recent work on “AI orchestration” highlights, enterprises risk AI tool sprawl without a platform-level layer that coordinates agents, enforces policies and connects to core systems

      </p>
      <p>
        Vidcomply treats AI as part of an end to end release pipeline rather than as isolated demos or individual tools. It focuses first on the workflows that already have budget and urgent pain: global enablement, marketing versioning, localization and compliance for streaming and film. The same architecture then extends naturally into AI native content as those organizations move more of their production onto generative tools, so that they can continue to “make anything” with Runway and Sora while using Vidcomply to decide what to make, how to make it safely and when it is truly ready for global release.

    <!-- Relationship to creative tools -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Relationship to creative tools (Runway, Sora, etc.)</div>
      <h2>We sit above creative toolkits as the release and governance layer</h2>
      <p>
        Tools like <a href="https://runwayml.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Runway</a> and emerging
        models such as Sora are becoming powerful creative environments. Runway explicitly positions itself as
        “a new kind of creative toolkit” with “everything you need to generate any video, image or piece of content you want,”
        along with node-based workflows to chain together models and modalities inside its own product
        <a href="https://runwayml.com/product" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Runway Product</a>,
        <a href="https://runwayml.com/enterprise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Runway Enterprise</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vidcomply does not try to replace these environments or compete on raw model quality. It assumes that creative teams will continue to use
        Runway, Sora, traditional NLEs, VFX tools and internal GenAI tools. Vidcomply sits above them as the orchestration,
        compliance and packaging brain for releases. It is neutral to which tool generated or edited a shot. Its job is to ensure
        that all assets across a campaign are safe, on-brand, consistent over time, platform-ready and fully documented.
      </p>
      <p>
        In broader enterprise AI, this orchestration and governance layer is now recognized as the missing piece.
        Work on “AI agent orchestration” describes the need for a platform-level layer that coordinates
        many models and agents, embeds governance and compliance, and provides a single source of truth, rather than a patchwork of clever tools

        <a href="https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/improve-workflow-efficiency-with-ai-agent-orchestration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Moveworks – AI agent orchestration</a>,
        <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/orchestration-the-missing-link-in-enterprise-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CACM – Orchestration: the missing link in enterprise AI</a>,
        <a href="https://www.uipath.com/ai/what-is-ai-orchestration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">UiPath – What is AI orchestration?</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vidcomply brings that orchestration mindset specifically to streaming and film releases. Runway and similar tools are
        “musicians” in the creative process. Vidcomply is the conductor and producer for the release: it knows every platform spec,
        every territory rule, every required asset, which model or tool produced each piece and the approval trail. As AI-generated content becomes more common and lower quality AI content floods open platforms, this separation between creative toolkits and a release brain becomes critical for teams that operate at scale and under regulatory and brand risk. Where it makes sense, Vidcomply can call out to these creative tools as steps inside its pipelines, while remaining the source of truth for global enablement and compliance.
