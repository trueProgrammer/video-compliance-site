    <!-- Summary -->

      <div class="section-title">Summary</div>
      <p>
        Vidcomply AI is a model-agnostic global release enablement platform for streaming and studios. It takes a title or campaign brief plus reference assets, plans what is needed for each platform and territory, orchestrates creative tools and AI models to generate, localize or reuse content, and enforces compliance before packaging everything for delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams generate and manage final release versions of full episodes, trailers, shorts and posters through one system that sits on top of their existing tools rather than replacing them. Vidcomplay AI lets teams focus on creativity and increases velocity for experimentation and adapting for new formats by reducing operational work and without breaking current workflows.
      </p>

        <div>
          <p>
            Video content is global by default. A single season or campaign can require many trailers, cutdowns, shorts, social promos and hundreds of image variants across platforms and territories. Each asset needs localized text, ratings, logos and legal elements and must follow regional and platform rules. Today this is managed with a patchwork of tools, agencies and spreadsheets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generative AI is already mainstream: around two thirds of companies use gen AI in production
            <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">McKinsey</a>,
            and most marketers report using AI weekly
            <a href="https://www.ama.org/marketing-news/generative-ai-takes-off-with-marketers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">AMA</a>.
            New video generators lower production cost and increase asset volume but introduce additional risk around compliance, rights, provenance and consistency. Enterprises are now talking about AI orchestration as the missing link between many tools and real workflows
            <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/orchestration-the-missing-link-in-enterprise-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CACM</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no shared release platform that understands the end-to-end title graph, covers episodes and marketing assets together, decides when to reuse or generate, and guarantees that final asset packs are safe, on brand and platform-ready for global release.

          Master trailers and posters created manually → local agencies and in-house teams create variants → legal and standards review links by email → last minute blurs and edits → tech ops discover issues close to delivery.
          New AI tools add more experiments and versions but no central control, governance or audit trail. Global distribution still depends on people chasing files and spreadsheets.

          <p>
            Vidcomply is the global release platform that plans and executes campaigns across human shot and AI generated content. It translates a brief and references into an asset plan by platform and territory, decides where to reuse or edit and where to generate from scratch, orchestrates tools like Runway, Sora, NLE and VFX, and enforces compliance before packaging for delivery. Think of it as a release graph for each title: assets, prompts, lineage, rules and statuses in one place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Execution can mean reusing existing footage or generating new shots and short clips from text and reference images or video through connected generators. Every asset is tracked with lineage, prompts, tools used and compliance status, so marketing, legal and operations share one view of “global readiness” instead of separate spreadsheets and links.

        <div class="card">
          <div class="label">One control plane with three layers</div>
          <div class="card-sub">Compliance engine</div>
          Checks human and AI-generated content against regional and platform rules, flags risky moments and can block risky prompts and storyboards before production. Outputs editor timelines and legal-ready summaries for long form, promos and shorts.
          <br /><br />
          <div class="card-sub">Marketing asset studio</div>
          Takes a brief and references and either repurposes existing material or, via integrated generators, creates new shots, short clips and key art. Produces localized and format-adapted variants per territory and platform, tightly linked to compliance and lineage.
          <br /><br />
          <div class="card-sub">Release planner</div>
          Takes a campaign brief and reference assets, derives the required asset list by platform and territory, and breaks it into concrete operations: reuse, edit or generate. Chooses which tools and models to call for each shot and tracks readiness and approvals for global launch.

    <!-- Why now & position vs creative tools -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Why now and position vs creative tools</div>
      <p>
        Generative AI use in media and marketing is now mainstream: most large brand owners already use gen AI in their marketing and a large majority of professional marketers and creators use it weekly for editing, enhancement and asset generation. At the same time, the number of platforms and territories is growing and rules around AI-generated and sensitive content are tightening.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tools like Runway, Sora and Veo are becoming powerful creative environments that can generate almost any shot or video. They lower production cost and raise content volume but do not address orchestration, compliance, provenance or global packaging. Existing creative automation platforms focus on ad-level variants, and traditional compliance tools stop at checks on finished files. Neither provides an end-to-end, AI-aware release control plane for titles and campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vidcomply does not try to win on raw model quality. It assumes creative teams will continue to use Runway, Sora, in-house models and traditional NLE and VFX tools. Vidcomply sits above them as the release and governance layer for streaming and film. It knows which assets are needed where, which model or tool produced each one, which rules they passed and when they are truly ready for global launch.
      </p>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="section-title">Traction, stage and model</div>
      <p>
        Vidcomply already has a working compliance engine for long form content, adaptable to shorter clips, and a marketing module for poster versioning with an early trailer localization pipeline. These capabilities are being exercised with real Prime Video marketing workflows as a design partnership, validating the problem and approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Business model: platform fee plus usage-based pricing at the high end, tied to titles and campaigns, with a lighter SaaS tier for smaller teams as AI video makes global distribution accessible to them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why us: the founder previously led technical and AI-heavy initiatives in Prime Video ads and virtual product placement, has shipped large-scale video and compliance systems for S&P 100 companies and bootstrapped a prior AI startup to millions in revenue. Vidcomply is currently founder-led and pre-revenue, focused on deep product fit with flagship design partners before scaling sales.
